# Steve Hong (Diligent Robotics - Frontend Assessment)

Hello! Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assessment.
I have completed the assessment using HTML, CSS, and React. I've completed the requirements, and also included the bonus requirements of using Typescript, reusable components, some unit tests, and 1 animation.

### Bonus Functionality

I noticed that the images returned from the API call often had multiple image sources in an array. Just as an addition, I thought I could add a handler for a user to click through each image (which will interchange as you click on the image). This functionality is in the component <ProductDisplay /> in the imageHandler function.

### Other Approaches Considered

An alternative approach I have considered is using Material UI for styling. For this particular task, I chose to stick with just CSS, HTML, and React, but I do enjoy the component structure of Material UI as I find it compatible and intuitive with React.

### Run The Project: `yarn start`
First, run `npm install` to install node_modules.
Then run `yarn start` to run the app.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Run Tests: `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
